## Important information regarding this version of the repo:

This is a public version of my work from a university assignment. The focus of the assignment was creating a website with a PHP backend. I just made this since I have this project listed in my resume and so I thought a public version should be made accessible. Actually running the website requires access to a database on my university's servers that I am not allowed to give access to. You could theoretically set it up to work with your own database but this repo is mostly just made to be used as a reference. The testing documents also give an idea of what the website actually looks like. Also unfortunately I had to wipe the commit history as previous commits contained the assignment instructions and posting them publicly would be violating my university's academic integrity policy.

## Word Scramble Game

### Summary

This assignment is split into two parts. The first part is a site that uses form processes to manipulates strings and arrays in various ways. The second part is a word scramble game. The word scramble game gives the user a random scrambled words that the user must then guess. It also features a scoreboard that contains the top scores. The possible words and scoreboard data are stored in a MySQL database.

### Extra Notes

This README is currently just designed to give an idea of what this project is. I plan to come back to this at some point with a more in depth README. However, this is less of a priority at the moment and I wanted to get a public version of my work out there as soon as possible.
